README / HOWTO for the usage of the transfer learned NN model for FAM/FAD presented in
Käser and Meuwly: Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys.,2022, 24, 5269. The PES is transfer learnt
to CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ level quality and can be used to predict energies, forces, 
dipole moments and partial charges. The README will walk through the dependencies
which are needed as well as a few illustrative examples for using the PES.


2) Folders =====================================================================
i) "tl_models": contains the NN models used throughout the paper. These files
   can be used to predict energies, forces, dipole moments, to run MD
   simulations, to predict normalmodes, etc. The folder contains:
       -tl_866_fad_ccsdt: starting from an MP2 model, the present model was transfer
            learnt to CCSD(T) quality using 866 (425 for FAM and 441 for FAD) ab initio
            points. 

ii) "NNCalculator": in ase a calculator is a black box taking atomic number and
     atomic position from an "atoms object" and calculate different properties
     [see:https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/calculators/calculators.html].
     ASE offers quite a large number of calculators and it is quite easy to
     implement new ones. The NNCalculator thus uses Physnet models and predicts
     properties based on a molecule.
iii) "HessianNNCalculator": same as NNCalculator but able to predict the hessian
     of a given molecule/geometry.
iv) "abinit": folder containing example ab initio optimizations at CCSD(T) level
     of theory carried out using MOLPRO. For FAM, the ab initio frequencies are
     given as well. 
================================================================================

3) Files =======================================================================
i) "fam.xyz & fad.xyz & fad_ts.xyz": xyz files of the monomer, dimer and TS for double
   proton transfer. The structures are very close to the optimum geometry.
ii) "Traj2Xyz.py": script to convert a trajectory file (.traj) (a main file format in
    ase) to the more common .xyz file.
iii) "xyz_to_traj.xyz": script to do the reverse conversion.
iv) "output_fam.dat": File containing the output for the prediction of fam.xyz using the
    PhysNet model.

4) Examples of Use: ============================================================
i) Energy, force and dipole moment prediction of a molecular geometry using
   "predict_mol.py". (The usage of the script is given in itself). Note that the
   units of the prediction are the same as the ones used in the training data
   set. Here, the energies are printed in eV, the forces in eV/angstrom and the
   dipole moments in elementary charges*angstrom. 
ii) Having a full dimensional potential one probably wants to perform geometry
    optimizations for different molecules. This can be done with the
    "optimize_coarse.py" script. When one is sure that the structure is already
    close to the optimum, one can use the "optimize_crit_fine.py" to further
    optimize the structure. "optimize_crit_fine.py" can also be used for TS
    optimization, however, a good estimate is needed!
iii) The NN potential can also be used to predict normal mode frequencies. Here,
    the HessianNNCalculator is used (which calculates the hessian and takes
    longer to evaluate) in combination with the "NN_NM.py" script. Remember to
    optimize the structure first! Alternatively, the frequencies can be
    calculated using ASEs "vibrations" class.  A possible implementation is
    given in "ase_vibrations.py" (The vibrational modes are calculated from a
    finite difference approximation of the Hessian matrix.).
